        Alan Turing was a British mathematician, logician, and cryptanalyst who played a pivotal role in the Allied victory in World War II. He devised the concept of a universal machine that could compute anything that is computable, now known as the Turing machine â€” a foundational concept in modern computing. Turing was instrumental in breaking the German Enigma code, a feat that significantly shortened the war. Despite his contributions, Turing faced persecution for his homosexuality and died under tragic circumstances. In 2009, the British government formally apologized for his treatment.
